## Overview

The goal of this project is to segment brain MRI images, identifying regions such as tumors using a deep learning–based segmentation model (e.g., U-Net). The notebook walks through the entire workflow:

* Loading and preparing the dataset
* Preprocessing MRI images
* Building a segmentation model
* Training on labeled MRI scans
* Evaluating performance
* Visualizing segmentation results
